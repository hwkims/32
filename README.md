# STM32F429I-Discovery LCD ASCII Art Demo
![IMG_2304](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/458eebb1-0d13-4f94-9bab-58532db11e78)

This repository contains firmware for the **STM32F429I-Discovery** board that displays a piece of ASCII art on the built-in LCD screen.

The project utilizes the STMicroelectronics HAL libraries and the Board Support Package (BSP) specifically designed for the Discovery board to interact with the LCD and SDRAM.

## Hardware Requirements

*   **STM32F429I-Discovery** development board
*   USB cable (Type-A to Mini-B) for programming (ST-LINK) and power

## Software & Tools

*   **STM32CubeIDE** (Recommended, as the project structure appears generated by it)
    *   Or a compatible toolchain (Keil MDK, IAR EWARM) capable of importing STM32CubeMX projects.
*   STMicroelectronics HAL Libraries & BSP (Included/Managed by CubeIDE/CubeMX)
*   (Optional) Serial terminal emulator (like PuTTY, Tera Term, Minicom) for viewing debug messages via UART1.

## Key Features

*   **LCD Display:** Initializes and uses the onboard LCD.
*   **SDRAM Framebuffer:** Configures the external SDRAM (connected via FMC) to act as the framebuffer for the LCD (address `0xD0000000`).
*   **BSP Usage:** Leverages the `stm32f429i_discovery_lcd.h` BSP for simplified LCD operations (Initialization, Layer Configuration, Clearing, Setting Colors/Fonts, Drawing Strings).
*   **ASCII Art:** Displays a multi-line ASCII art graphic centered on the screen.
*   **Custom Styling:** Sets a black background and yellow text color using `BSP_LCD_SetBackColor` and `BSP_LCD_SetTextColor`.
*   **Font Selection:** Uses `Font8` for rendering the text.
*   **Peripheral Initialization:** Includes standard initialization code for necessary peripherals (LTDC, DMA2D, FMC, GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI - though I2C/SPI might not be actively used for the core ASCII art display).
*   **printf Retargeting:** Redirects `printf` output to UART1 (USART1: PA9=TX, PA10=RX, Baud Rate: 115200) for simple debugging messages.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hwkims/32.git
    cd 32
    ```
2.  **Open the project:**
    *   Launch STM32CubeIDE.
    *   Go to `File` > `Open Projects from File System...`.
    *   Select the cloned `32` directory.
    *   Ensure the project is selected and click `Finish`.
3.  **Connect the board:** Connect your STM32F429I-Discovery board to your computer using the ST-LINK USB (Mini-B) connector.
4.  **Build the project:**
    *   Right-click on the project (`32` or similar name) in the Project Explorer.
    *   Select `Build Project` (or press `Ctrl+B`).
5.  **Flash the firmware:**
    *   Right-click on the project again.
    *   Select `Run As` > `STM32 Application` or `Debug As` > `STM32 Application`. This will build (if necessary) and flash the code onto the board.
6.  **Observe:** The LCD screen on the Discovery board should initialize and display the yellow ASCII art on a black background.
7.  **(Optional) View Debug Output:**
    *   Connect a USB-to-Serial adapter to the correct pins for USART1 (Typically PA9 for TX, PA10 for RX - check the board schematic if unsure).
    *   Open a serial terminal program configured for the adapter's COM port at **115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)**.
    *   Reset the board. You should see the "HELLO, STM32" message printed in the terminal.
